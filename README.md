## ðŸ’¡ How to Use

### Option 1: CLI Prompt

Run the app and type your prompt:

```
uv run main.py
```

You will be asked for an idea (e.g. "Build a blog using Django").

The generated files will appear in the `generated/` folder.

---

### Option 2: Use as a Module

You can also import the agent and use it programmatically from another script:

Create a file named `run_prompt.py`:

```python
from main import run_agent_with_prompt

run_agent_with_prompt("Build a responsive landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript")
```

Then run it:

```bash
uv run run_prompt.py
```

This will generate a fully working landing page in the `generated/` directory without any manual input.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Example

```bash
$ uv run main.py

ðŸ§  Enter your prompt:
Build a calculator web app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

âœ… Code has been generated in the `generated/` folder!

$ tree generated/
generated/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.js
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â””â”€â”€ styles.css
```

Open `index.html` in your browser and enjoy your AI-generated app! ðŸŽ‰
